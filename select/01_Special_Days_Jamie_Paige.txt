It's a special day today
I'm setting time aside to pray
That maybe things might change a bit this year
But I'm a fool for having dreams
Or at least that's what it seems
Since I'm on the outside looking in at you

I wonder why I never got that lovin' for myself
Is it because I made you mad or brought you down?
I don't know why I've never had that lovin' for myself
I'm just a mess sometimes I'm sorry if I've ever let you down

Oh I can see
Why I may feel so lonely
I'm trying to make due
Without you

Spending special days alone
Wishing you were here
We're all just spending special days alone

And I am praying for the day
When I can look to you and say
My love I am so glad to be with you

It's another special day
And yet again alone I stay
It seems my luck is always running out
But maybe I deserve this mess
God knows I am not the best
Yeah I'm slowly losing my own peace of mind

I wonder why I never got that lovin' for myself
Is it because I'm always insecure and sad?
I don't know why I've never had that lovin' for myself
I'm just a lonely little mess and maybe I just bring you down

It can't be true
That I'm not good enough for you
I think I'm way too hard on myself

Spending special days alone
Wishing you were here
We're all just spending special days alone

And I am praying for the day
When I can confidently say
I'm deeply endless in love with you

And I have fallen to my knees
To beg myself to air my pleas
I won't let loneliness destroy me!

I'm a mess
My seams are bursting I confess
But maybe I could spend the day with you?

Spending special days alone
Wishing you were here
We're all just spending special days alone
But now it all seems clear
I'll never spend another day alone

And I am praying for the day
That I don't have to hide away
And I can live my life next to you

And I am praying for the day
When I can look to you and say
My love I am so glad to be with you
